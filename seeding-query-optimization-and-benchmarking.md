This guide will walk you through setting up a test database, seeding it with large datasets, optimizing SQL queries, and benchmarking their performance using Azure Data Studio.

1. **Setting Up Your Environment in Azure Data Studio**

   **Install and Set Up Azure Data Studio**
   - Download and Install: Get Azure Data Studio from the [official Microsoft website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download).
   - Connect to SQL Server: Open Azure Data Studio, click "New Connection," and enter your SQL Server instance details.

   **Create a Test Database**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE BenchmarkDB;
   GO
   USE BenchmarkDB;
   GO
   ```

2. **Seeding Large Tables with Data**

   **Creating the Schema**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Customers (
       CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       Name NVARCHAR(100),
       Email NVARCHAR(100),
       Address NVARCHAR(200)
   );

   CREATE TABLE Orders (
       OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       CustomerID INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID),
       OrderDate DATETIME,
       OrderTotal DECIMAL(10, 2)
   );

   CREATE TABLE OrderItems (
       OrderItemID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       OrderID INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Orders(OrderID),
       ProductID INT,
       Quantity INT,
       Price DECIMAL(10, 2)
   );
   ```

   **Seeding Data with Millions of Rows**
   ```sql
   -- Insert 1 million customers
   INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, Name, Email, Address)
   SELECT TOP 1000000
     ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)),
     CONCAT('Customer', ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL))),
     CONCAT('customer', ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)), '@example.com'),
     CONCAT('Address', ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)))
   FROM sys.objects;

   -- Insert 10 million orders
   INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, OrderTotal)
   SELECT TOP 10000000
     ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)),
     ABS(CHECKSUM(NEWID())) % 1000000 + 1,
     DATEADD(DAY, ABS(CHECKSUM(NEWID())) % 365, '2023-01-01'),
     ABS(CHECKSUM(NEWID())) % 1000 + 1
   FROM sys.objects o1, sys.objects o2;

   -- Insert 30 million order items
   INSERT INTO OrderItems (OrderItemID, OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, Price)
   SELECT TOP 30000000
     ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)),
     ABS(CHECKSUM(NEWID())) % 10000000 + 1,
     ABS(CHECKSUM(NEWID())) % 10000 + 1,
     ABS(CHECKSUM(NEWID())) % 10 + 1,
     ABS(CHECKSUM(NEWID())) % 500 + 1
   FROM sys.objects o1, sys.objects o2, sys.objects o3;
   ```

3. **Benchmarking SQL Queries**

   **Running Your Queries**
   Write and execute the SQL query you want to benchmark:
   ```sql
   SELECT CustomerID, SUM(OrderTotal) AS TotalSpent
   FROM Orders
   GROUP BY CustomerID
   ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC;
   ```

   **Enable and View Execution Plan**
   - Include Execution Plan: Click on “Include Actual Execution Plan” in Azure Data Studio.
   - Run the Query: Execute by pressing F5. Review the “Execution Plan” to identify costly operations like table scans.

   **Using SQL Server’s Built-In Tools for Benchmarking**
   - **SET STATISTICS TIME**: Measure CPU time and elapsed time.
     ```sql
     SET STATISTICS TIME ON;
     SELECT CustomerID, SUM(OrderTotal) AS TotalSpent
     FROM Orders
     GROUP BY CustomerID
     ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC;
     SET STATISTICS TIME OFF;
     ```

   - **SET STATISTICS IO**: Measure I/O operations.
     ```sql
     SET STATISTICS IO ON;
     SELECT CustomerID, SUM(OrderTotal) AS TotalSpent
     FROM Orders
     GROUP BY CustomerID
     ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC;
     SET STATISTICS IO OFF;
     ```

   - **Query Performance Insight**: Use Azure Data Studio’s Query Performance Insight extension to track performance over time.

4. **Optimizing SQL Queries**

   **Examples and Optimizations**

   **Example 1: Inefficient Join**
   - **Original Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT o.OrderID, c.Name, o.OrderDate
     FROM Orders o
     JOIN Customers c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
     WHERE o.OrderDate BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
     ```
   - **Optimization**:
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_CustomerID ON Orders(CustomerID);
     CREATE INDEX idx_OrderDate ON Orders(OrderDate);

     SELECT o.OrderID, c.Name, o.OrderDate
     FROM Orders o
     JOIN Customers c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
     WHERE o.OrderDate BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
     ```

   **Example 2: Aggregating Data**
   - **Original Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT ProductID, COUNT(*) AS TotalOrders, SUM(OrderTotal) AS TotalSales
     FROM Orders
     GROUP BY ProductID
     ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
     ```
   - **Optimization**:
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_ProductID ON Orders(ProductID);

     SELECT ProductID, COUNT(*) AS TotalOrders, SUM(OrderTotal) AS TotalSales
     FROM Orders
     GROUP BY ProductID
     ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
     ```

   **Example 3: Subquery Optimization**
   - **Original Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT Name
     FROM Customers
     WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders WHERE OrderTotal > 500);
     ```
   - **Optimization**:
     ```sql
     SELECT DISTINCT c.Name
     FROM Customers c
     JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
     WHERE o.OrderTotal > 500;
     ```

   **Example 4: Complex Filtering and Sorting**
   - **Original Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT o.OrderID, c.Name, o.OrderTotal
     FROM Orders o
     JOIN Customers c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
     WHERE o.OrderDate BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
       AND o.OrderTotal > 1000
     ORDER BY o.OrderTotal DESC;
     ```
   - **Optimization**:
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_OrderDate_OrderTotal ON Orders(OrderDate, OrderTotal);
     CREATE INDEX idx_CustomerID ON Orders(CustomerID);

     SELECT o.OrderID, c.Name, o.OrderTotal
     FROM Orders o
     JOIN Customers c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
     WHERE o.OrderDate BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
       AND o.OrderTotal > 1000
     ORDER BY o.OrderTotal DESC;
     ```

   **Example 5: Pagination with OFFSET-FETCH**
   - **Original Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM Orders
     WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
     ORDER BY OrderDate;
     ```
   - **Optimization**:
     ```sql
     -- Assuming pagination parameters @PageNumber and @PageSize
     DECLARE @PageNumber INT = 1;
     DECLARE @PageSize INT = 100;

     SELECT * FROM Orders
     WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
     ORDER BY OrderDate
     OFFSET (@PageNumber - 1) * @PageSize ROWS
     FETCH NEXT @PageSize ROWS ONLY;
     ```

   **Example 6: Using Query Hints**
   - **Original Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderTotal
     FROM Orders o
     WHERE o.CustomerID = 123456;
     ```
   - **Optimization with Hint**:
     ```sql
     SELECT /*+ INDEX(Orders idx_CustomerID) */ o.OrderID, o.OrderTotal
     FROM Orders o
     WHERE o.CustomerID = 123456;
     ```

5. **Analyzing and Reporting Results**

   **Compare and Document Performance Gains**
   - **Initial Metrics**: Record execution time and I/O statistics before optimization.
   - **Post-Optimization Metrics**: Record these metrics again after applying optimizations.
   - **Report Example**:
     - **Before**: Query took 10 seconds and had 500,000 logical reads.
     - **After**: Query took 2 seconds and had 50,000 logical reads.

   **Generate Reports**
   - Use Azure Data Studio’s charting tools or export data to Excel/CSV to create visual reports that show performance improvements.

6. **Best Practices**

   - **Regular Monitoring**: Continuously monitor and benchmark queries as data volume grows.
   - **Iterative Testing**: Apply and test optimizations iteratively to ensure performance gains.
   - **Staging Environment**: Test optimizations in a staging environment before applying them to production.
